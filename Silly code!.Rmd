Make a plot showing the relationship between depth and clarity in the diamonds dataset.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data("diamonds")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth, clarity))+
  geom_bar()+ #Bar graphs don't like x and y variables like this, so either the graph type needs to be changed or we need to use fill=clarity in the line above
  theme(classic)+ #No object called classic. Code should be theme_classic()
  geom_smooth(method=lm) #Need parentheses around lm argument
```
